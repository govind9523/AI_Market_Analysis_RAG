# 🤖 AI Market Analyst RAG System
This project is an intelligent, local-first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to analyze a market research report for a fictional company, "Innovate Inc." It is optimized to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware with as little as 8GB of RAM.

The system provides a web-based interface to interact with the document, allowing users to perform three main tasks: ask specific questions (Q&A), get comprehensive summaries, and extract structured data in JSON format. A key feature is its autonomous routing capability, where an AI agent analyzes the user's query and automatically selects the most appropriate tool for the job.

## ✨ Features

* **Q&A Tool**: Ask specific questions about the report (e.g., "What is FutureFlow's market share?") and get precise answers derived directly from the text.
* **Summarizer Tool**: Generate concise, comprehensive summaries of the entire document or specific sections.
* **Data Extractor Tool**: Extract structured information, such as financial figures or competitive metrics, and return it in a clean JSON format.
* **Autonomous Routing**: The system intelligently analyzes your query to automatically select and deploy the best tool (Q&A, Summarizer, or Extractor) to fulfill your request.
* **Web Interface**: A simple and intuitive frontend to interact with the RAG system, view results, and inspect metadata.
* **Local & Private**: Runs entirely on your local machine. The LLM is loaded from a local file, ensuring your data remains private.
* **Optimized for 8GB RAM**: All components, from the embedding model to the vector store and LLM, are chosen to be lightweight and memory-efficient.

## 🧠 Design Decisions (Crucial)

This section justifies the key technical choices made in this project, with a focus on balancing performance and resource constraints.

### 1. Chunking Strategy

* **Choice**: Fixed-size chunking with a character size of **512** and an overlap of **77** characters.
* **Justification**:
    * **Memory Efficiency**: This strategy, implemented in `document_loader.py`, is computationally inexpensive and avoids the memory overhead of more complex methods like semantic chunking, which would require loading additional NLP models.
    * **Optimal for Embedding Model**: The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model has a maximum sequence length of 256 word pieces. A chunk size of 512 characters (roughly 100-120 words) fits comfortably within this limit, ensuring no context is lost during embedding.
    * **Contextual Integrity**: The 77-character overlap (around 15% of the chunk size) is a crucial heuristic. It helps ensure that concepts or sentences that are split across two chunks are still contextually linked, improving the retrieval accuracy for queries whose answers lie at the boundary of a chunk.

**Selected Over**: nomic-embed-text, bge-large-en-v1.5, OpenAI ada-002

**Quantitative Justification**:
- Memory footprint: 90MB vs 500MB+ for alternatives
- Embedding dimensions: 384 vs 768 (50% memory reduction)
- Inference speed: 3x faster on CPU vs larger models
- Model parameters: 22.7M vs 100M+ for comparable models

**Technical Rationale**:
- CPU-optimized architecture eliminates GPU dependency
- Normalized embeddings improve FAISS search performance
- Proven benchmark performance on semantic similarity tasks
- Minimal Python dependencies (no PyTorch Lightning, etc.)
   

### 2. Embedding Model

* **Choice**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from the `sentence-transformers` library.
* **Justification**:
    * **Performance vs. Size**: This model provides an excellent balance. It is highly performant for its small size (only 80 MB) and delivers strong results on semantic search tasks.
    * **Speed & Efficiency**: It is designed to be fast and lightweight, making it ideal for running on a CPU without causing a bottleneck during the document indexing phase.
    * **High-Quality Embeddings**: Despite its size, it produces 384-dimensional embeddings that are effective for similarity search, making it a perfect fit for an 8GB RAM system where larger models would be impractical.

**Selected Over**: nomic-embed-text, bge-large-en-v1.5, OpenAI ada-002
**Quantitative Justification**:
- Memory footprint: 90MB vs 500MB+ for alternatives
- Embedding dimensions: 384 vs 768 (50% memory reduction)
- Inference speed: 3x faster on CPU vs larger models
- Model parameters: 22.7M vs 100M+ for comparable models

**Technical Rationale**:
- CPU-optimized architecture eliminates GPU dependency
- Normalized embeddings improve FAISS search performance
- Proven benchmark performance on semantic similarity tasks
- Minimal Python dependencies (no PyTorch Lightning, etc.)


### 3. Vector Database

* **Choice**: `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
* **Justification**:
    * **In-Memory & Fast**: FAISS is a library, not a standalone database server. It operates entirely in memory, which makes it incredibly fast for similarity searches on datasets that fit into RAM, like the document in this project.
    * **CPU Optimization**: It is highly optimized for CPU-based similarity search, which is a key requirement for running on systems without a dedicated GPU. We use `IndexFlatIP` (Inner Product), which is efficient for the normalized embeddings produced by our chosen model.
    * **Minimal Overhead**: It has a very low dependency footprint and requires no complex setup, making it easy to integrate directly into the Python application, as seen in `vector_store.py`.

**Selected Over**: ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus

**Quantitative Justification**:
- Memory overhead: <50MB vs 200MB+ for full databases
- Search latency: <100ms for 10K vectors vs 500ms+ for alternatives
- Storage efficiency: 1.5MB per 1000 384-dim vectors
- No persistent connections or background processes

**Technical Rationale**:
- Battle-tested by Meta across billions of vectors
- IndexFlatIP optimized for normalized embeddings
- CPU-specific algorithms (no wasted GPU optimizations)
- Zero external dependencies or services

### 4. Data Extraction Prompt

* **Choice**: A multi-faceted prompt engineering strategy.
* **Justification**:
    * **Role-Playing**: The prompt begins by assigning a role: `You are a data extraction specialist.` This immediately puts the LLM in the correct context to perform a specific, non-conversational task.
    * **Explicit Instructions**: The prompt provides clear, direct guidelines, such as `Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or explanations` and `Use "null" for missing information`. This strict guidance prevents the LLM from adding conversational filler that would break the JSON format.
    * **Schema Reinforcement**: As seen in `extractor.py`, the prompt dynamically includes the expected JSON schema (e.g., for financial data or SWOT analysis). This tells the model the exact structure and keys to use, dramatically increasing the reliability of the output.
    * **JSON Response Format**: The `llama-cpp-python` library is instructed to use a JSON response format (`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`). This leverages the model's built-in capabilities to generate valid JSON, which is far more reliable than just asking it to do so in the text of the prompt.

### 5. LLM Choice

* **Choice**: `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` (Q4_K_M GGUF Quantization).
* **Selected Over**: Smaller models like Phi-2, larger open models like Mistral 7B, and API-based models like GPT-4.
* **Justification**:
    * **Quantitative Rationale**:
        * **Memory Usage**: The 4-bit quantized model has a RAM footprint of ~5 GB, making it viable for an 8GB system while leaving room for the OS and other application components. This is significantly lower than larger models like Mistral 7B (~10-14GB for a similar quantization).
        * **Performance**: It delivers excellent reasoning and instruction-following capabilities for its size, outperforming smaller models and rivaling larger ones on the specific tasks of this project (Q&A, summarization, extraction).
        * **Inference Speed**: Achieves reasonable inference speeds on CPU/GPU, making the user experience interactive without the latency of a larger model.
    * **Technical Rationale**:
        * **Local-First & Private**: Using `llama-cpp-python` to run a local GGUF model ensures that all data processing happens on the user's machine. This is a critical feature for privacy and eliminates reliance on external APIs, network latency, and cost.
        * **High-Quality Quantization**: The `Q4_K_M` quantization method is known for maintaining a high degree of accuracy (often 95%+) compared to the original 16-bit model, while providing a massive (~75%) reduction in model size. This makes it the ideal choice for powerful, resource-constrained local deployment.

### 6. Key Configuration Parameters

Beyond the major components, several small but important parameters were tuned for optimal performance on an 8GB system.

* **`temperature: 0.2`**: This controls the randomness of the LLM's output. A low value like 0.2 makes the responses more focused and deterministic, which is crucial for an analytical tool where factual accuracy is more important than creativity.

* **`n_ctx=2048`**: This sets the context window size (in tokens) for the LLM. 2048 is a conservative choice that allows the model to consider a sufficient amount of retrieved context while carefully managing memory usage to prevent overloading an 8GB system.

* **`n_gpu_layers=0`**: This parameter determines how many model layers are offloaded to a GPU. By setting it to `0`, we force the model to run entirely on the CPU, ensuring the application works reliably on machines without a powerful or compatible GPU.

# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Manual Setup
Follow these steps to set up the environment manually.

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install "numpy<2.0" # Downgrade numpy to avoid conflicts
    ```

3.  **Download and place the LLM**:
    * Download the `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf` model file.
    * Move the downloaded `.gguf` file into the root directory of this project.

4.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

### Docker Deployment
You can also run the application using Docker. Note that you must have the model file downloaded in the project directory first.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ai-market-analyst .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-market-analyst
```

---
## 🔌 API Usage

You can interact with the API using any HTTP client, such as `curl`.

### 1. Q&A Task

To ask a specific question, send a POST request to the `/query` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/query' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "What is the projected market size by 2030?",
  "tool": "qa"
}'
```

### 2. Summarization Task

To get a summary of the document.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/query' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "Summarize the competitive landscape",
  "tool": "summarize"
}'
```

### 3. Data Extraction Task

To extract structured data as JSON.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/query' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "Extract key financial data",
  "tool": "extract"
}'
```

### 4. Autonomous Routing

To let the AI decide which tool to use, omit the `tool` parameter.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/query' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "What are the main threats to Innovate Inc?"
}'
```
The system will analyze the query and route it to the appropriate tool (in this case, likely the Q&A or Extractor tool for a SWOT analysis).
